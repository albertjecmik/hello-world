# hello-world
Hi, 
I am twentyone year old male, who is starting out to learn about web development currently I am mainly focusing on JavaScript. My plan is to focus mainly on React, but will see what will give the most satisfaction in the world of Web Development. Hopefully, this Git will serve as a portfolio for my work.
Until we see each other (in the case of the pandemic - until we hear each other).
Cheers,
Albert Jecmik
